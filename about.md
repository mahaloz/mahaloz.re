# About

Hi, I'm [Zion Leonahenahe Basque](https://zionbasque.com) a native Hawaiian hacker, better known as mahaloz ([mahal0z](https://twitter.com/mahal0z) on Twitter). 
I'm a previous co-captain of the [ctf](https://ctftime.org/about/) team [Shellphish](https://twitter.com/shellphish?lang=en). 
I love reverse engineering, decompilation, and binary analysis. 
I'm a PhD student in the Arizona State University [SEFCOM](https://ctftime.org/about/) research lab. 
My research also focuses on reverse engineering, with special regard to decompilation. 
My research advisors are the renowned [Dr. Fish Wang](https://ruoyuwang.me/) & [Dr. Yan Shoshitaishvili](https://www.yancomm.net/).
