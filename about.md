# About

Hi, I'm [Zion Leonahenahe Basque](https://zionbasque.com) a native Hawaiian hacker, better known as mahaloz. I'm the co-captain of the [ctf](https://ctftime.org/about/) team [@Shellphish](https://twitter.com/shellphish?lang=en) and the previous president of the [@asuhackingclub](http://asuhacking.club). I love reverse engineering, pwning, exploration robotics, and computers in general. I'm a PhD student in the Arizona State University [SEFCOM](https://ctftime.org/about/) research lab. My research also focuses on reverse engineering, with special regards to decompilation. My research advisors are the renowned [Dr. Fish Wang](https://ruoyuwang.me/) & [Dr. Yan Shoshitaishvili](https://www.yancomm.net/).

This is my technical blog. I post all things hacking related here. If you want to learn more about me professionally, check out my professional page [@zionbasque.com](https://zionbasque.com).
